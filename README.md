LennyTool

Second Version of this little tool I made for fun.
If you have feature requests/ questions or something else related to this, feel free to message me.

What this tool can do:

	- download most recent lenny text file that acts as database for the lennys
	- view the lennys in UTF-8
	- copy the shown lenny to your clipboard by clicking the button next to it
	- the text boxes are manually editable
		- feature planned to manually add new ones with own lennys

Should you use the tool and think it is useful or not yet useful enough, I'd be glad to hear your feedback and ideas.


PS: Do mind that the tool minimizes to the notification tray without showing up in the taskbar. You can switch to it using alt+tab though.
